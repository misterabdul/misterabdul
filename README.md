I love everything about computers from the perspective of software & programs since the first sight while I was still in Junior High School. Currently I'm working as a software developer at [PT. Xtend Integrasi Indonesia](https://xtendindonesia.co.id/), mainly focus on back-end side of a system and using PHP programming language and Laravel framework. Outside of working time, I love playing games & watch random youtube videos. I also like everything about Japanese culture, I like to watch anime, read manga, listen to Japanese music, playing Japanese game, and learn everything about Japanese culture.
